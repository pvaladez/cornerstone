## Node and NPM Updates by pvaladez

> Because Node version 10 is almost end of life and the stencil-cli documentation version [recommends version 12](https://developer.bigcommerce.com/stencil-docs/installing-stencil-cli/installing-stencil), I have followed instructions from the cornerstone readme by deleting package-lock.json and installing npm packages with node version 12.21.0 and npm version 6.14.11. I might stick with npm version 6.11.3 if the site were going to actually be used, but why not help test out newer versions :slightly_smiling_face:
